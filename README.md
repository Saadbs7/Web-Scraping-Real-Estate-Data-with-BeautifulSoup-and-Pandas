# Web Scraping Real Estate Data with BeautifulSoup and Pandas

This Python script scrapes real estate data from a specific website using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. It fetches information about apartments available for rent in Frankfurt am Main and organizes it into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

The script will fetch real estate data from the provided URL and create a DataFrame with columns: "Link", "Description", "Price", "Area", "Rooms", and "Address". You can then manipulate and analyze the data as needed.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

BeautifulSoup

Requests

Pandas

You can install them using pip:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
```
